Note on development:
	
	Since a lot of my classes are beginning to start, development of anime-dl may start to stall in regards to update patterns; I will still attempt to work on this in my free time, but between life, school, and a number of projects, I can not guarantee new features or updates for awhile.
	However, I will still fix any bugs that crop up quickly, but I must ask those, who use or modify this project, to help me in finding bugs, thank you!
	Also, since my development environment has moved from mainly windows-10 to linux with a windows guest, expect better support for linux.


Note on Server-Modification:

	This is a version of ADLCore that has been modified so that it can function in a server-environment more easily.

## Example Usage (outdated)

[![Example](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YgfuUqdk1fw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgfuUqdk1fw)

To download an anime:
'anime-dl ani -s Jerou -d' OR run the EXE and type: 'ani -s Jerou -d'

Explanation: 
The "ani" switch tells the program to select the anime downloader, the -s switch tells the program to search for an anime called "Jerou," the -d switch tells the program to download the anime.


To download a novel and export it to epub:
>'anime -dl nvl -d -e {link to novel page}'

To convert an already downloaded novel to epub:
> 'anime-dl nvl -e {path to novel on disk}'
