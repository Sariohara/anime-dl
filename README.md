To download an anime:
'anime-dl ani -s Jerou -d' OR run the EXE and type: 'ani -s Jerou -d'

Explanation: 
The "ani" switch tells the program to select the anime downloader, the -s switch tells the program to search for an anime called "Jerou," the -d switch tells the program to download the anime.


To download a novel and export it to epub:
>'anime -dl nvl -d -e {link to novel page}'

To convert an already downloaded novel to epub:
> 'anime-dl nvl -e {path to novel on disk}'
