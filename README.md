### NOTE: This is the C# version of anime-dl, there is also a [JS](https://github.com/vrienstudios/anime-dl/tree/JS) version in case you're interested in that. For differences between these two versions please see this entry [Differences between C# and JS versions](https://github.com/vrienstudios/anime-dl/wiki/Differences-between-C%23-and-JS-versions), although you should be generally fine using the C# version.

To download an anime:
'anime-dl ani -gS Jerou -d' -- With the advent of our UI, this will become much easier.

Explanation: 
The "ani" switch tells the program to select the anime downloader, the -gS switch tells the program to search for an anime called "Jerou" on gogo-anime the -d switch tells the program to download the anime.


To download a novel and export it to epub:
>'anime -dl nvl -d -e {link to novel page}'

To convert an already downloaded novel to epub:
> 'anime-dl nvl -e {path to novel on disk}'
