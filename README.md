# Vidstream Downloader
This is app is for downloading anime and other shows from Vidstream.io. 

# How does it work?
Well, it basically acts as a web crawler; it gets every link associated with the series that you wish to download, and then it gets the ids for those videos. Vidstream.io uses an ID system to decide which video the server will serve to you. We can easily get the direct url to the content from this server through a get request.

# Usage
Right now, Vidstream Downloader is in its infancy, and a lof of features are missing. However, it still serves its purpose.

example usage: VidStreamIORipper.exe -S "Legend of the Galactic Heroes"

Also, before you complain about links being invalid, links expire rougly a day after they were made.

# Available parameters:

-S | Search option incase you only know the name of the show.


# Future Version Releases
